<title>Cuneiform Font from modified transliteration</title>

<body>
<h1>Modified transliteration to cuneiform</h1>
How does it work? 
<ul>
<li>Cuneiform sign variants can be created using the PaleoCodage encoding which can be tested <a href="https://situx.github.io/SemanticDictionary/cuneistrokeorder.html">here</a></li>
<li>PaleoCodage cuneiform sign variants get a distinct ID which is used to identify the character.</li>
<li>IDs are used as teh basis for the modified transliteration</li>
<li>A WOFF font is generated and included in this homepage so that the transliteration can be converted to cuneiform</li>
</ul>
Example transliteration:
<table><tr><td>
<span>
TAB_v1
</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="costum">
TAB_v1
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
